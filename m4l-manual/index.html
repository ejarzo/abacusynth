      <h1>Overview</h1>
      <p>
        The Abacusynth is a polyphonic synthesizer plugin for Ableton Live. It
        is fundamentally an additive synthesizer, so you create the sound by
        adding and manipulating oscillators (as represented by shapes).
      </p>

      <h2>Controls</h2>
      <p>
        When the plugin loads the rods will be empty and it will not make any
        sound. Build your synth sounds by placing shapes on the rods.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each shape represents an oscillator. The rod it is on represents its
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic">harmonic</a>, so shapes
        on the lowest rod will oscillate at the fundamental frequency, those on
        the second rod will oscillate at twice the fundamental, etc. The type of
        shape represents its waveform (circle -> sine wave, square -> square
        wave, equilateral triangle -> triangle wave, right triangle -> sawtooth
        wave).
      </p>

      <p>
        Each shape/oscillator also has several parameters that can be adjusted.
        <strong
          >This is done by dragging the shape while holding modifier
          keys.</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>This video demonstrates how to control the shapes.</p>

      <p>
        <strong>Moving</strong>
        a shape left or right on the rod adjusts the cutoff frequency of a low
        pass filter so shapes on the left sound "darker" and shapes on the right
        sound "brighter". This effect reflected in the UI by displaying the rods
        as a gradient from dark to light.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>SHIFT+Dragging</strong>
        a shape lets you control its volume (dragging up/down), as represented
        by size, and stereo pan effect (dragging left/right), as represented by
        spin/rotation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>CMD+Dragging</strong>
        lets you adjust a shape's vibrato, as represented by a ruler of varying
        length (dragging left/right) and divisions (dragging up/dow).
      </p>

      <h2>Demo</h2>
      <p>
        Here is a more stylistic compilation of some sounds you can achieve with
        this plugin.

      <h2>More on how it works</h2>
      <p>

      </p>

      <p>
        In this diagram we see that four shapes have been placed using the
        interface. This means that four oscillators are active for each note
        played. The incoming frequency (the blue note) is multiplied based on
        the rod that the shapes are located, and the different types of shape
        each produce different waveforms (as described above). The
        shape-specific effects also modulate the sound here -- these are
        described in detail above. The four signals are then combined and fed
        through the ADSR envelope, the parameters of which are controlled
        through the interface, and then sent to the output.
      </p>
      <p>
        This whole process happens for each "voice" of the synth. A voice only
        operates on one fundamental frequency, so multiple voices are required
        if we want to play more than one note at the same time -- this is called
        polyphony. The gray "Voice 2" box is meant to represent the same exact
        process as Voice 1, but for a different note.
