      <h1>Abacusynth: User Manual</h1>
      <p>
        The Abacusynth is a polyphonic synthesizer plugin for Ableton Live. It
        is fundamentally an additive synthesizer, so you create the sound by
        adding and manipulating oscillators (as represented by shapes).
      </p>

      <h2>Demo</h2>
      <p>
        Here is compilation of some sounds you can achieve with this plugin. For
        more details on how to use the interface, see below.
      </p>

      <h2>Controls</h2>
      <p>
        Each shape represents an oscillator. The rod it is on represents its
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic">harmonic</a>, so shapes
        on the lowest rod will oscillate at the fundamental frequency, those on
        the second rod will oscillate at twice the fundamental, etc. The type of
        shape (circle, square, equilateral triangle, right triangle) represents
        its waveform (sine, square, triangle, sawtooth, respectively).
      </p>

      <p>This video demos how to control the shapes.</p>

        Each shape/oscillator also has several parameters that can be adjusted.
        This is done by dragging the shape while holding modifier keys. In the
        above video I demonstrate the modulations you can adjust on a shape.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Moving</strong> a shape left or right on the rod adjusts the
        cutoff frequency of a low pass filter so shapes on the left sound
        "darker" and shapes on the right sound "brighter". This effect reflected
        in the UI by displaying the rods as a gradient from dark to light.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>SHIFT+Dragging</strong> a shape lets you control its volume
        (dragging up/down), as represented by size, and stereo pan effect
        (dragging left/right), as represented by spin/rotation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>CMD+Dragging</strong> lets you adjust a shape's vibrato, as
        represented by a ruler of varying length (dragging left/right) and
        divisions (dragging up/dow).

      <h2>More on how it works</h2>

        In this diagram we see that four shapes have been placed using the
        interface. This means that four oscillators are active for each note
        played. The incoming frequency (the blue note) is multiplied based on
        the rod that the shapes are located, and the different types of shape
        produce different waveforms (as described above). The shape-specific
        effects also modulate the sound here -- these are described in detail
        below. The four signals are then combined and fed through the ADSR
        envelope, the parameters of which are controlled through the interface,
        and then sent to the output.
      </p>
      <p>
        This whole process happens for each "voice" of the synth. A voice only
        operates on one fundamental frequency, so multiple voices are required
        if we want to play more than one note at the same time -- this is called
        polyphony. The gray "Voice 2" box is meant to represent the same exact
        process as Voice 1, but for a different note.
