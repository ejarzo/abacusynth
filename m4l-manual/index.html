    <h1>Abacusynth: Max for Live Plugin</h1>
    <p>The Abacusynth is a polyphonic synthesizer plugin for Ableton Live.</p>

    <h2>How it Works</h2>
    <p>
      A shape represents an oscillator. The rod it is on represents its
      [harmonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic), so shapes on the
      lowest rod will oscillate at the fundamental frequency, those on the
      second rod will oscillate at twice the fundamental, etc. The type of shape
      (circle, square, equilateral triangle, right triangle) represents its
      waveform (sine, square, triangle, sawtooth, respectively).
      ![abacusynth-flow-diagram](abcs-diagram-2.png) In this diagram we see that
      four shapes have been placed using the interface. This means that four
      oscillators are active for each note played. The incoming frequency (the
      blue note) is multiplied based on the rod that the shapes are located, and
      the different types of shape produce different waveforms (as described
      above). The shape-specific effects also modulate the sound here -- these
      are described in detail below. The four signals are then combined and fed
      through the [ADSR
      envelope](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Envelope_(music)>), the
      parameters of which are controlled through the interface, and then sent to
      the output. This process happens for each "voice" of the synth. A voice
      only operates on one fundamental frequency, so multiple voices are
      required if we want to play more than one note at the same time -- this is
      called polyphony. The gray "Voice 2" box is meant to represent the same
      exact process as Voice 1, but for a different note.
