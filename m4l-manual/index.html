      <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The Abacusynth is a polyphonic synthesizer plugin for Ableton Live. It
        is fundamentally an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_synthesis" target="blank">additive synthesizer</a>, so you create the sound by
        adding and manipulating oscillators (as represented by shapes in the interface).
      </p>

      <h2 id="demo">Demo</h2>
      <p>
        Here is a compilation of some sounds you can achieve with this plugin.
      </p>
      <iframe
        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
        allowfullscreen
        frameborder="0"
        height="472.5"
        width="840"
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b5UOwJX5gpk"
        title="YouTube video player"
      ></iframe>

      <h2 id="controls">Controls</h2>
      <p>
        When the plugin loads the rods will be empty and it will not make any
        sound. Build your synth sounds by placing shapes on the rods.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each shape represents an oscillator. The rod it is on represents its
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic">harmonic</a>, so shapes
        on the lowest rod will oscillate at the fundamental frequency, those on
        the second rod will oscillate at twice the fundamental, etc. The type of
        shape represents its waveform (circle -> sine wave, square -> square
        wave, equilateral triangle -> triangle wave, right triangle -> sawtooth
        wave).
      </p>

      <p>
        Each shape/oscillator also has several parameters that can be adjusted.
        <strong
          >This is done by dragging the shape while holding modifier
          keys.</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>Dragging</h3>
        Moving a shape left or right on the rod adjusts the cutoff frequency of a low
        pass filter so shapes on the left sound "darker" and shapes on the right
        sound "brighter". This effect reflected in the UI by displaying the rods
        as a gradient from dark to light. Moving it up or down changes its harmonic.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>SHIFT+Dragging</h3>
        Hold SHIFT while dragging to control a shape's volume (dragging up/down), as represented
        by size, and stereo pan effect (dragging right/left), as represented by
        spin/rotation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>CMD+Dragging</h3>
        Hold CMD while dragging to adjust a shape's vibrato, as represented by a ruler of varying
        length (drag right to increase/left to decrease) and divisions (dragging up/down).
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>Double Click</h3>
        Double click to delete a shape.
      </p>

      <h2 id="usage-in-ableton">Usage in Ableton</h2>
      <h3 id="saving-presets">Saving Presets</h3>
      <p>
        The device allows you to load several pre-installed presets. However, if
        you would like to save your own, you can use the built in Ableton Preset
        system. Click the save icon in the top right of the device to do this.
      </p>
      <img src="save-button-screenshot.png" />

      <h3 id="recording-automation">Recording Automation</h3>
      <p>
        One limitation of the device is that changes you make to the shapes are
        not recorded as automation. To get around this, I recommend
        <a
          href="https://www.ableton.com/en/manual/routing-and-i-o/#15-5-internal-routings"
          >recording the track output to a new audio track</a
        >
        so that you can save longer evolving progressions.
      </p>
      <p>Changes to the ADSR envelope can be recorded as automation.</p>

      <h3 id="managing-plugin-window">Managing the Plugin Window</h3>
      <p>
        You can use the tab control on the device to control the plugin window.
        "Auto" means the plugin window will open when the track is selected,
        "Close" will keep it closed when switching tracks, and "Open" will keep
        it open.
      </p>

      </p>

      <p>
        In this diagram we see that four shapes have been placed using the
        interface. This means that four oscillators are active for each note
        played. The incoming frequency (the blue note) is multiplied based on
        the rod that the shapes are located, and the different types of shape
        each produce different waveforms (as described above). The
        shape-specific effects also modulate the sound here -- these are
        described in detail above. The four signals are then combined and fed
        through the ADSR envelope, the parameters of which are controlled
        through the interface, and then sent to the output.
      </p>
      <p>
        This whole process happens for each "voice" of the synth. A voice only
        operates on one fundamental frequency, so multiple voices are required
        if we want to play more than one note at the same time -- this is called
        polyphony. The gray "Voice 2" box is meant to represent the same exact
        process as Voice 1, but for a different note.
