The Abacusynth is a synth inspired by an [abacus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abacus) and the interaction is centered on placing shapes on rods. Each rod is set to a frequency in the harmonic series, and each shape represents an [oscillator](https://www.innovativesynthesis.com/basic-synthesis-part-1-%E2%80%93-oscillators/) oscillating at that frequency. The different shapes represent the oscillator's wave type (sine, square, triangle, sawtooth).

## How to use

Place shapes on the rods to start producing sound. Shapes on the lowest rod produce the fundamental frequency. You can change the note by pressing the keys `asdfghjk`.

Drag shapes will move them from left to right or from rod to rod.

If holding the `ALT` or `OPTION` key on your keyboard, dragging a shape adjusts it's vibrato rate (dragging up/down) and depth(dragging right/left). This will cause the shape to move on the rod.

If holding the `SHIFT` key, dragging adjusts the shape's size panning speed which correspond to the sound's volume and panning speed, respectively.

Click "Randomize" will clear the current state and randomly generate shapes.
